	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Putting matters as neutrally as possible, I can summarise the background as follows. The Claimants are siblings. Sunhill House, a property in rural Sussex, was in the Claimants&#8217; family for many years. It was occupied by the Claimants&#8217; parents until they moved to Somerset in late August 2023. They sought a buyer and, after one sale fell through, they eventually succeeded in selling it in March 2024. The Defendants live in a nearby property, Rystwood Lodge. Between the two properties is a field (&#8216;the Field&#8217;). This too has been in the Claimants&#8217; family for many years and is presently owned by the Claimants, who would like to sell it. They allow a local person to graze sheep on it. The only vehicular access to the Field is from the driveway to Rystwood Lodge (<span style="font-weight:bold">the Drive</span>) via a gate close to the beginning of the Drive. The Drive is owned by the Defendants but the owners of the Field have a right of way over it. The Drive also serves another property, Rystwood Acre.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_4">

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The Drive has a simple, post and rail fence running along the boundary with the Field. In about August 2022, the Claimants erected a six-foot wood panel fence running parallel to the Defendants&#8217; fence but within the boundary of the Field. They say they did this, in summary, because they did not want to be spoken to or observed by the Defendants when they and their families were using the Field.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The Defendants are strongly opposed to the Field being built on for housing. The Claimants say they have never wished to build on the Field but the Defendants are concerned that they will sell it to someone who does. As long ago as March 2021, the Defendants wrote to the Claimants stating, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;we will do whatever it takes to protect the value of our estate&#8221;</span>. The Claimants&#8217; parents offered to sell the Field to the Defendants but negotiations broke down. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The Defendants&#8217; chosen method of protecting the Field (as they would see it), or interfering with the Claimants&#8217; rights to use and dispose of the Field (as the Claimants would put it) has been to raise multiple disputes about the right of access and related matters. This has already led to litigation in the County Court which was settled in June 2023 on agreed terms set out in a schedule to a consent order. The schedule states that  &#8220;the full terms of the right of way&#8221; are as set out in a conveyance dated 2 November 1967 (<span style="font-weight:bold">the Conveyance</span>). In summary, the Conveyance states that the owners of the Field have a &#8220;full right of way&#8221; (pedestrian and vehicular) over the whole of the Drive up to the boundary of Rystwood Lodge &#8220;for the purpose only of the use of [the Field]&#8221; subject to the owners contributing to the upkeep of the Drive. It does not specify the amount of such contribution. The owners of Rystwood Acre also have a right of way over part of the Drive and the relevant conveyance for that property specifies that the owners must contribute 50% of the costs of maintaining that part of the Drive. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">It might have been thought that relations between the parties would improve once the County Court litigation had been resolved. However, not long afterwards, the Defendants raised more issues: they dispute that they have an obligation to maintain a fence between Rystwood Lodge and the Field; they assert they have an easement of drainage over the Field relating to a disused cesspool, to which they say the Claimants have blocked access; they object to any utilities serving the Field being connected to their own pipes and cables; they assert that they are entitled to charge the Claimants 50% of the cost of maintaining the whole of the Drive; and they assert that the new fence that the Claimants have erected in the Field deprives their property of light and amounts to private nuisance (<span style="font-weight:bold">the New Dispute</span>).</p>

They each served a Witness Statement with the Acknowledgment of Service. The Claimants served evidence in reply on 21 June 2024. Meanwhile, the Claimants issued this on-notice application for an interim injunction on 11 June 2024 supported by further witness statements. The Defendants have served evidence in response to the application.</p>

I refused the application for cross-examination and gave my reasons orally. I adjourned the application for transfer to Part 7 until I had heard the interim injunction application, since that would give me a greater insight into the extent of factual disputes in the case.

On 7 September, I note, the First Claimant emailed the Defendants asking them not to contact his siblings but expressly inviting them to correspond with him in an effort to avoid involving external lawyers again.

Their first two reasons (unaware that Girlings were instructed; responding to direct communication from the First Claimant) would seem to evaporate by late September 2023. In her First Witness Statement, the First Defendant advances miscellaneous reasons in respect of later direct correspondence (e.g. urgency on some occasions; the time it was taking for Girlings to respond; the need to inform the Claimants directly of the Defendants&#8217; response to Girlings&#8217; &#8220;threats&#8221; of trespass and criminal damage; the disproportionality of sending invoices to Girlings when they were for modest sums). For the most part, these look like ex post facto justifications. In many respects they are founded on interpretations of events which themselves seem exaggerated (e.g. the &#8220;threats&#8221; made by Girlings, to which I return below). The more likely analysis, on present evidence, is that the Defendants chose to contact the Claimants directly when that would serve to place them under additional pressure.</p>

Thus, informing them that the Claimants propose to tarmac a short stretch of the verge to facilitate entrance through the gate into the Field becomes a &#8220;threat of criminal damage&#8221;; an offer to sell the Defendants the Field becomes &#8220;blackmail&#8221;; a reference in a pleading to the First Defendant&#8217;s nationality becomes &#8220;racially aggravated harassment&#8221; and so on. I return to some of these examples below. The allegation once made, is then added to their list of complaints and frequently repeated, including to third parties. </p>

The same points are made at great length again and again. The Defendants say that this is because the Claimants and Girlings were not answering their questions. It is likely that the trial Judge will take the view that it is more a case that the Claimants and Girlings were not giving the Defendants the answers they wanted. An inability to take &#8220;no&#8221; for an answer is often said to be a hallmark of harassment. The First Claimant gives, as an example, September 2023, when the Defendants were writing to the Claimants, Girlings or Jackson Stops on average every three days.</p>

In any event, as Mr Nicholls said, harassment is often not about how things start, but how they carry on.

I think it unlikely therefore that the trial Judge will feel able to dismiss this as six of one, half a dozen of another. I also consider that the Judge is likely to find that the correspondence to Girlings targets the Claimants. The Claimants still have to be informed about it and give instructions on it and so it is likely to be considered just another way of wearing the Claimants down.</p>

It offered to sell the Defendants the Field for &#163;400,000 (which was said to be half the price that the Field could be sold to a developer for) and suggested that this would be in the Defendants&#8217; interests because it would increase the size and value of their property and allow them to &#8220;secure the view&#8221; , so that the Field would remain &#8220;the open field that you wish to see&#8221;. On 2 August 2022, Girlings wrote to the Defendants telling them that the Claimants intended to erect the new fence. The reasons given were (in summary) the unwelcome attention the Claimants felt they had been receiving from the Defendants when they were in the Field and hence their desire to &#8220;avoid further confrontation and stress&#8221;.</p>

But more to the point, the characterisation of this as a &#8220;threat&#8221; seems extreme when the Claimants are simply notifying the Defendants of a proposal aimed at solving another problem and asking when it might be convenient to undertake the work.

The allegations sometimes featured prominently in the subject line of emails. By way of example, I was shown an email to Jackson Stops on 19 January 2024 alleging blackmail; allegations to Mr Mallinson in an email dated 24 November 2023  (headed &#8220;trespass and criminal damage&#8221;) and threatening to report the First and Third Claimants to the Solicitors Regulation Authority; an email to the Third Claimant&#8217;s employers dated 24 November (headed &#8220;threat of property damage by Victoria Russell&#8230;&#8221;), and another email to her employers on 26 November 2023 repeating the allegation of threatened criminal damage.</p>

The First Defendant says she did this to ascertain how their legal expenses insurance with DAS Insurance would work in the event that the Claimants tarmacked the Drive and the Defendants then wished to obtain legal advice due to them under their policy in circumstances where the related company, DAS Law, would be conflicted because they employ the Third Claimant. </p>

The insurance contract is poorly evidenced at present. All the Defendants have provided is a policy summary from 2018 which says that customers of DAS Insurance benefit from a 24-hour helpline operated by DAS Law offering telephone advice &#8220;on any personal legal issue&#8221;. It is not clear whether the First Defendant was even availing herself of that service when she first contacted DAS Law.</p>

To establish this likelihood, the Court does not need to rely on the attendance note of the First Defendant&#8217;s initial telephone contact with DAS Law (which she says is a forgery).

That ought to have allayed the Defendants&#8217; purported concerns (or rather, the trial Judge is likely to think so), but instead the First Defendant persisted in corresponding with Mr Ellerton, even after he told her in terms that he regarded the correspondence to be at an end. </p>

Suffice it to say that, on an objective reading, it suggests that the Defendants were seeking to deter people from buying Sunhill House unless they were also prepared to buy the Field on terms that would prevent it from being developed. The Defendants do not appear to dispute this. The correspondence included suggestions that the First Claimant and his parents had committed blackmail  and that the Second Claimant had made a false complaint to the police. It appears that these allegations were included to add emphasis to a suggestion that, if they remained owners of the Field, the Claimants would sell it for development (whatever they might have said to the contrary). These representations were made with typical forcefulness. The agents were told that they must pass this information on to prospective buyers, and that they would be in breach of their relevant statutory obligations if they did not.</p>

It ought to have been a matter for sensible negotiation. Instead, the demand for payment on a 50% basis came out of the blue and was accompanied by a threat to charge interest at 8% above base rate and to lock the gate to the Field if payment was not made. Soon afterwards, the Defendants began to mention a possible six-figure sum for resurfacing (of which the Claimants would be charged 50%). Whether or not the Defendants are correct and this work does need doing and will be expensive, the manner in which they introduced it into the correspondence is likely to be seen as overbearing. The Defendants began to assert with increasing regularity that the Claimants were trespassers while the invoices remained unpaid (something Mr Nicholls disputes as a matter of law, but which I do not need to decide). Latterly they widened this allegation to include Gill Bennett, writing to her twice in one day to allege that she would be a trespasser if she brought her sheep on the field. Unsurprisingly, she ceased doing so which, the First Claimant explains, created a further problem for the Claimants because the grass in the Field is now growing uncontrollably. This is likely to be seen as another method of targeting the Claimants. </p>

However, I consider that the Court is likely to see it as part of a course of conduct on which the Claimants are entitled to rely. It appears to be an attempt to interfere with the Claimants&#8217; rights to instruct lawyers of their own choosing and it is likely to have exacerbated their distress.

The impression I have formed on the documentary evidence so far available is that the Defendants will indeed &#8220;do whatever it takes&#8221; (as they threatened to back in 2021) to force the Claimants to deal with the Field in a way that suits the Defendants&#8217; wishes. The Court is likely to find that their conduct has been oppressive, unacceptable,  and of an order which would sustain criminal liability under PfHA s.2. The Court is likely to find that this was calculated to cause the Claimants alarm and distress and has in fact done so. The Court is likely to reject the defence of reasonable conduct and likely to put in place permanent injunctive relief.</p>

In his First Witness Statement dated 18 April 2024 (just before the sale of Sunhill House was completed the First Claimant wrote, when explaining the need for an injunction: <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;I am also concerned that the Defendants&#8217; behaviour will put off the buyer that my parents&#8217; estate agents have found for Sunhill, </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">who would also like to buy the Field and Ditch Strip but will not do so until these issues are resolved</span><span style="font-style:italic">&#8221;</span>(my emphasis).

It is only now that Sunhill House has been sold that we feel able to bring these proceedings.

That is not inconsistent with saying that he wanted to wait until the House itself was sold before issuing proceedings. I do not consider that this was a deliberate attempt to mislead.</p>

They were asking how legal advice might be provided by DAS Law in a hypothetical situation which might arise in the future (and the Court is likely to find that this was just a pretext for making defamatory allegations about the Third Claimant).

The First Defendant says that her call with DAS Legal Expense Insurance was strictly confidential but, if so, I do not see how the Third Claimant could or should have known this based on what she was told. Most likely it struck her as a continuation of the allegedly harassing conduct that had occurred the previous November.

One of the features of harassment is that its alarming and distressing effects increase over time so the fact that a claimant could have, but did not, take action at an earlier stage in the course of conduct counts for little if that course of conduct is continuing. Here, it was continuing: the Defendants emailed the solicitors for the purchaser of Sunhill House  on 17 April 2024 (two days before proceedings were issued) in an apparent attempt to derail the sale. I cannot see how the timing of the claim has been prejudicial to the Defendants.</p>

The difficulty with that is that the Defendants appear to have a very broad conception of what counts as unlawful, and are quick to allege unlawful activity, so this promise may not give the Claimants much protection. Moreover, I was shown instances in the past where the Defendants have said they would not communicate with one person or another but have then resumed doing so, and the Defendants have declined to give undertakings. Since proceedings were issued they have continued to complain about the Claimants&#8217; choice of legal representatives and have spoken about the Third Claimant to an affiliate of DAS Law. There is therefore a real risk in my judgement that they will continue to behave as before if I were to refuse an injunction.</p>

First, because the Defendants have a habit of making demands and saying words to the effect of &#8220;if we do not hear back from you, we shall take it that you agree&#8221;, so the Claimants cannot safely ignore emails from them if they are sent.

I have explained above that I am not making findings of fact about the Defendants&#8217; conduct in this Judgment. Any reputational harm will be limited and can be repaired at trial if it turns out to have been unwarranted. I am not as optimistic as the Defendants about the trial coming on swiftly and the Claimants have explained that the new owner of Sunhill House is unwilling to exercise his option to buy the Field until the issues around the right of way have been resolved. In the meantime, in my judgement, there is a pressing need to put these limited restrictions in place for the benefit of the Claimants which outweighs the inconvenience to the Defendants.</p>

Further, the Claimants seek damages for alarm and distress and it is clear that the Defendants dispute the fact, extent and causation of this.

The claim will need careful case management and the Court will be astute to ensure that these proceedings do not themselves become another form of harassment.
