The court case involves Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and two other generic drug companies (Arrow Generics Ltd and Generics (UK) Ltd) as claimants against Istituto Gentili SpA and Merck & Co Inc as defendants. The claimants sought the revocation of two patents related to the pharmaceutical compound alendronate, which is used to treat conditions like osteoporosis. The judgment, delivered by The Honourable Mr Justice Jacob, concluded that both patents were invalid due to lack of novelty and obviousness, as the claims made in the patents were anticipated by prior art and did not demonstrate any inventive step.
